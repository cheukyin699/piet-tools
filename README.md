# piet-tools

A set of tools for interpreting programs drawn in the style of Piet.

If you are confused as I used to be about what all this hoopla is about, [here
is an excerpt from the site][piet-site]:

> Piet is a programming language in which programs look like abstract
> paintings. The language is named after Piet Mondrian, who pioneered the field
> of geometric abstract art.
